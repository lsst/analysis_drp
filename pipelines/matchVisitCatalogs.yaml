    Match visit level catalogs with reference catalogs for QA.
    For visit level tasks the bands needs to be set to [""] to allow the code to be reused between
    the coadd level tables, which have band_ prepended to their column names, and the visit level
    tables which do not.
parameters:
  band: i
tasks:
  match_astromRefCat_visit:
    class: lsst.analysis.drp.catalogMatch.CatalogMatchVisitTask
    config:
      selectorActions.flagSelector: VisitPlotFlagSelector
      sourceSelectorActions.sourceSelector.band: ""
      python: |
        from lsst.analysis.drp.dataSelectors import VisitPlotFlagSelector
